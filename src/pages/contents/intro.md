Dee Yeum, also known as *ChefYeum*. Originally born in Seoul 🇰🇷. Grew up in Edinburgh 🇬🇧.

I study Informatics at the University of Edinburgh where I also work as a researcher and a TA.

Outside the academia, I work as a software engineer and go to hackathons. See [Resume](https://chefyeum.github.io/resume) for details.

Having done culinary courses in [ESFW](https://www.esfw.com/) and [ICCA](https://iccadubai.ae/), cooking has been a big part of my life.
